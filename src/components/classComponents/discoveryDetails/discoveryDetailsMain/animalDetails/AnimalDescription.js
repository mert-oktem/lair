                    leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and strong, it carries
                    and hides unfinished kills so that they are not taken by
                    other predators. It has been reported that some males
                    stay with females after mating, and may even help with
                    rearing the young. Several males sometimes follow and
                    fight over a female.</p>
