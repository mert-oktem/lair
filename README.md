Lair - Protecting Species At Risk
https://lair.wmdd.ca/

Lair is a responsive and data-driven web application, that provides information about endangered species in Canada to encourage users to discover their local threatened animals. This online platform will let the user take an active and meaningful role in providing relief to the wildlife and natural ecosystems of our planet.

*-----Main Features-----*

Interactive Map - There is an interactive map of Canada, where users can click on a province to see a list of endangered species and their locations on the map. 

Animal Wiki - The website provides a list of Canada’s endangered species with information such as general and scientific names, species descriptions, habitats, threats, population trends, genus, and average characteristics. Users can see the animal’s location and population on a map of Canada. To access more details about a specific animal, the user can click on the animal to see a line graph of population changes over time. 

Wildlife Articles - Users can see instructions and tips on wildlife conservation. Practical measures on how users can help save wildlife will be listed. 

Donation Portal - Through our responsive data-driven web application, we will also point users in the right direction to donate to wildlife protection agencies and NGOs that are best positioned to take on an active role in saving the ecological integrity of the environment and wildlife. Moreover, information on why and how donation helps will also be presented. 

*-----Tech Stack-----*

React framework is used to develop the front-end of this web application Node.js for the backend. The interactive map was created using D3.js and the data-driven feature that displays the number of species over the past ten years is depicted by the line graph made using Highcharts. 
The database was created using MySQL. Express.js was used for our API along with Joi.js for validation requests.
